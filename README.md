## Code Refactor Challenge - Horiseon

## Description
The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing code of a marketing agency's website so it meets a certain set of standards to make it more accessible. Ensuring people with certian disabilities can have access to the website using assistive tecnologies such as screen readers as well as being optimised for search engines.

The criteria was to refactor the code to follow a semantic strucure of HTML elements while being coherent with the CSS as well as making sure the code falls in a sequential order without changing the web application's appearence or functionality. Adding semantic elements to the code meant replacing the div tags which gave the code a clean and concise look , in addtion to condensing reptitive code in HTML and CSS look thus making it easier for future developers to read and edit. To increase accessibility as well as search engine optimisation; the use of alt attributes meant that descriptions of the images would display if there was to be issues of loading the image. In addition , making the titile of web application more descriptive promotes the agency through search engine optimisation. 

This project aided my learning of:
* The use of semantic elements to make a structured html page
* Search engine optimisation
* The use of GitHub repos
* Structuring code so it falls in a sequential way
* Coding in a way that meets accessibility standards
* Condensing HTML and CSS attributes
* Writing a README file

## Usage
The website is easy to use with three navigation links that can be used by clicking on them which wil redirect the user to the informative description and image of said link.
